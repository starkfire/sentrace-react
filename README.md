# Sentrace

### **A BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Contact Tracer for Project Sentinel**

## Overview

Sentrace is a mobile application that uses BLE (_Bluetooth Low Energy_) to supplement contact tracing.

## Design

Sentrace only requires two key information: a unique identifier (`uniqueId`) which is automatically generated by the app after installation, and the Bluetooth address of the device.

Sentrace detects all Bluetooth-enabled devices in range and logs their MAC addresses, which may be served by the device in random for security ([Read More](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/bluetooth-technology-protecting-your-privacy/)).

## Limitations

The app may not support devices with older versions of Android (i.e. Android 4 and below).

Additionally, it may not support and detect devices that do not implement Bluetooth LE.

## Development
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/starkfire/sentrace-react.git
cd sentrace-react
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
npx react-native link react-native-ble-plx
```
Start Metro
```
npx react-native start
```
Open another terminal to build the app
```
npx react-native run-android
```
You can test the app on a device through USB, `adb`, or Wi-Fi (see [guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)).

## Troubleshooting
#### Error: Device is not authorized to use BluetoothLE
Please enable location permissions for the app.

**_Note:_** While Sentrace does not actually store location data, Android requires location permissions for Bluetooth scans to work properly (see Android's [official guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le#permissions) for BLE).
